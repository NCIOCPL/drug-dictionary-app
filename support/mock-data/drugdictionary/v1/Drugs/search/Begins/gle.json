Upon oral administration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, glecaprevir inhibits the HCV NS3/4A serine protease enzyme, thereby disrupting the cleavage of the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins and preventing the formation of the viral replication complex. Pibrentasvir inhibits the activity of the NS5A protein, leading to disruption of the viral RNA replication complex, blockage of HCV RNA production, and inhibition of viral replication. HCV is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family; HCV infection is associated with the development of certain cancers.",

Upon administration, the monoclonal antibody CR011 moiety binds to glycoprotein nmb (GPNMB), expressed on the surfaces of a variety of cancer cell types; upon endocytosis, the synthetic  dolastin analogue MMAE is released via enzymatic cleavage into the tumor cell cytosol, where it binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which may result in G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. The vc linkage system is highly stable in serum, rendering the cytotoxicity of glembatumumab vedotin specific for GPNMB-positive cells.
