Following direct administration of E-101 solution into the surgical incisional wound via microspray, the enzyme GO converts oxygen into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In turn, p-MPO catalyzes the reaction of H2O2 with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is formed through oxidation of the chloride ion, to generate singlet oxygen (O2*). As p-MPO binds to microorganisms, O2* is able to exert direct oxidative damage to microorganisms, resulting in potent antimicrobial activity. E-101 may act as an anti-bactericidal agent against a variety of microorganisms, including multidrug-resistant strains. This may prevent infection at the surgical site.",

				"text": "An oral tablet formulation containing zoledronic acid combined with a proprietary absorption enhancer for improved zoledronic acid gastrointestinal absorption with anti-bone-resorption activity. The third-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their dissolution and inhibiting the formation and aggregation of these crystals. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. The proprietary absorption enhancer is a GRAS (generally-recognized-as-safe) food additive. \n"

This leads to a reduction in the force and rate of cardiac contractions and thereby preventing tachycardia, arrythmias and/or hypertension. At higher doses, esmolol also blocks beta-2 receptors located in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, thereby leading to smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, esmolol exerts a peripheral analgesic effect and intraoperative use of this agent may decrease the amount of opioid administration postoperatively. As the ester moiety in esmolol is rapidly hydrolyzed byplasma esterases, this agent has a very short half-life.",

Upon administration of etirinotecan pegol (EP), the agent penetrates into the leaky tumor vasculature and accumulates in the tumor. The linker slowly hydrolyzes and releases irinotecan, which leads to sustained exposure of the tumor to irinotecan. In turn, irinotecan is converted to the biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38) by a carboxylesterase. SN38 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex of topoisomerase I and DNA; this results in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptosis. Pegylation provides improved systemic exposure, increases drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance, thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic effects while lowering the toxicity profile.",

				"text": "A population of ex vivo expanded, CD34-positive-enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), which are derived from allogeneic human umbilical cord blood (UCB), and are co-cultured and expanded with a proprietary preparation of human endothelial cells (ECs), which are genetically modified with an adenovirus (Ad) vector that includes the Ad E4 region that encodes the ORF1 (E4ORF1) gene, that can be used for transplantation. Upon transplantation of the expanded cord blood stem cells mixed with engineered human ECs AB-110, the UCB-derived cells can differentiate into a variety of cell types and promote blood cell recovery. Compared to bone marrow transplants, these HPCs demonstrate a decreased risk of causing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), increase survival and enhance the potential for transplant and engraftment in any given patient as there is no need for a matched donor. Compared to HPCs alone, inclusion of the ECs increases blood stem cell count, enhances engraftment potential and increases the chances for blood cell recovery, thereby further increasing the potential for a successful cord blood transplantation. Insertion of the Ad E4ORF1 gene enhances survival and replication of the ECs ex vivo, preserves the ECs' vascular functions and improves the ability of the ECs to secrete angiocrines, which promotes stem cell proliferation and increases engraftment."

Upon oral administration, EZH2 inhibitor CPI-0209 selectively targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of EZH2. Inhibition of EZH2 specifically prevents the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). This decrease in histone methylation alters gene expression patterns associated with cancer pathways and results in decreased proliferation of EZH2-expressing cancer cells. EZH2, an HMT class enzyme and the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation; its expression is correlated with tumor initiation, progression, stem cell self-renewal, migration and angiogenesis.\n"
