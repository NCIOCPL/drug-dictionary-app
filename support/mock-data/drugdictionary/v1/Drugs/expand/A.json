This results in the proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells.

In turn, VEGF-C induces vascular and lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation locally, and may help re-grow the lymphatic system and improve symptoms associated with lymphedema (LE). VEGF-C, a lymphatic growth factor, plays a key role in (lymph)angiogenesis and the functioning of the lymphatic system."

Using TALEN technology, the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain and CD52 genes are deleted from the CAR19 T cells.

CD19 antigen is a B-cell specific cell surface antigen expressed in all B-cell lineage malignancies. Deletion of the CD52 gene makes the modified donor T cells resistant to the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab, which is used during lymphodepletion. The knockout of the TCR alpha gene eliminates TCR expression and is intended to abrogate the potential induction of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) by the donor T cells. The gene-edited allogeneic, frozen UCART19 have reduced production times and provide off-the-shelf CAR-T cells when compared to autologous CAR-T cells, which use the patient's own cells and are produced on an individual basis.

In addition, these cells target, bind to and kill NKG2DL-expressing tumor-associated endothelial cells in the neovasculature and immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that express NKG2D ligands. Gamma/delta T lymphocytes play a key role in the activation of the immune system and do not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mediated antigen presentation to exert their cytotoxic effect. Ligands for NKG2D, such as MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA), MICB, and members of the UL16-binding proteins (ULBP)/retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAET1) family, are overexpressed on infected cells and most cancer cell types, but are not expressed on most normal, healthy cells.\n"

In the CNS the antinociceptive activity of this agent may involve high affinity binding to and inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and/or the enhancement of  the action of serotonin at the spinal terminals of an opioid-mediated intrinsic analgesia system.",

Ampicillin, a broad-spectrum, semisynthetic penicillin, binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, thereby interfering with the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity. As a result, the cell wall is weakened and the cell lyses.

Upon administration of anti-aBCMA/aCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody TNB-383B, this bispecific antibody binds to both CD3 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and BCMA found on BCMA-expressing tumor cells. This activates and redirects CTLs to BCMA-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of BCMA-expressing tumor cells. BCMA, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that is specifically overexpressed on malignant plasma cells, plays a key role in promoting plasma cell survival.

The cytokines used, usually interferon-gamma (IFNg), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and IL-2, stimulate the proliferation and maturation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into CIK cells. Anti-CD3 stimulation allows for the CIKs' improved lytic activity."

Upon intravenous administration, the AFAIKL2 antibody fragment moiety of L-DOS47 specifically targets and binds to CEACAM6 expressed on certain tumor cells. In turn, the urease moiety of L-DOS47 catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia, which is further hydrolyzed to produce hydroxyl ions, and causes a locally increased concentration of the toxic waste product ammonia, which under normal conditions is converted into the nontoxic substance urea via the urea cycle.

        "text": "A lyophilized formulation of DOS47, an immunoconjugate composed of AFAIKL2, a recombinant camelid single-domain antibody which recognizes carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6), and the enzyme urease derived from the plant Canavalia ensiformis (Jack bean), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, the AFAIKL2 antibody fragment moiety of L-DOS47 specifically targets and binds to CEACAM6 expressed on certain tumor cells. In turn, the urease moiety of L-DOS47 catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia, which is further hydrolyzed to produce hydroxyl ions, and causes a locally increased concentration of the toxic waste product ammonia, which under normal conditions is converted into the nontoxic substance urea via the urea cycle. This increases the pH of the tumor microenvironment and alkalinizes the highly acidic environment that is needed for cancer cell survival and proliferation.

Upon intravenous administration of the anti-EphA2 antibody-directed liposomal docetaxel prodrug MM-310, the anti-EphA2 moiety selectively targets and binds to cells expressing EphI3:I12A2. Following accumulation of MM-310, docetaxel is slowly released from MM-310 and accumulates at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor vasculature. In turn, docetaxel is taken up by tumor cells, where it binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This results in cell cycle arrest and the induction of cell death. The cell-surface receptor EphA2, a member of the ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are involved in mammalian development, is overexpressed by a variety of cancer cell types and plays an important role in tumor growth; its expression is associated with poor prognosis. Compared to free docetaxel, MM-310 increases docetaxel's half-life, and provides enhanced and specific accumulation in EphA2-expressing tumors, thereby increasing docetaxel's efficacy while lowering its systemic toxicity.\n",

Upon administration of anti-globo H/MMAE ADC OBI 999, the antibody moiety of OBI 999, OBI 888, targets and binds to globo H on tumor cells and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Upon proteolytic cleavage, MMAE targets and binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2/M checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in globo H-expressing tumor cells.

        "text": "An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of OBI-888 (OBI 888), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) globohexaosylceramide (globo H), covalently linked to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), an auristatin derivative and a potent microtubule disrupting agent, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of anti-globo H/MMAE ADC OBI 999, the antibody moiety of OBI 999, OBI 888, targets and binds to globo H on tumor cells and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Upon proteolytic cleavage, MMAE targets and binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2/M checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in globo H-expressing tumor cells.

Upon intravenous administration of the anti-IL-4/IL-13 combination agent QBX258, the two antibodies VAK694 and dectrekumab target and block the activity of the two cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, respectively, which prevents IL-4/IL-13-mediated signaling.

By reducing the excess volume, QBX258 may improve lymphatic and arm functions. The development of lymphedema after lymphatic injury is associated with tissue inflammation, the infiltration of CD4-positive cells and their differentiation to the type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) phenotype.

        "text": "A combination agent composed of the two human monoclonal antibodies VAK694 (VAK296), targeting interleukin-4 (IL-4), and dectrekumab, targeting IL-13, that can potentially be used to block signaling mediated by IL-4 and IL-13. Upon intravenous administration of the anti-IL-4/IL-13 combination agent QBX258, the two antibodies VAK694 and dectrekumab target and block the activity of the two cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, respectively, which prevents IL-4/IL-13-mediated signaling.  In patients with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL), this agent may prevent lymphedema-associated effects, such as fibrosis, hyperkeratosis, the deposition of fibroadipose tissue, fluid accumulation, limb swelling, reduction of skin elasticity, and pain. By reducing the excess volume, QBX258 may improve lymphatic and arm functions.

It is overexpressed in certain tumor cell types and is a key regulator of multiple genes controlling tumor cell survival."

PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion."

NaPi2b, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in transport of inorganic phosphate and the maintenance of phosphate homeostasis.\n"

Upon administration of anti-PD-1/CD47 infusion protein HX009, the agent simultaneously and selectively targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on T lymphocytes and CD47 on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by HX009 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1 blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore effector T-cell functions and may further activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell killing. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-1, HX009 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. \n",

Upon intravenous administration, ARC fusion protein SL-279252 simultaneously binds to both tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4; OX40) and PD-1 expressed on T lymphocytes. Stimulation of OX40 may promote cytokine production and induce proliferation of memory and effector  T lymphocytes against tumor cells, while PD-1 binding disrupts PD-1 signaling and may restore immune function through the activation of T cells. This may enhance the immune-mediated elimination of tumor cells more effectively than PD-1 blockade or OX40-agonism alone.

        "text": "An agonist redirected checkpoint (ARC) fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of human programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 (TNFSF4; OX40 ligand; OX40L; CD252), linked by a central Fc domain (PD1-Fc-OX40L), with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, ARC fusion protein SL-279252 simultaneously binds to both tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4; OX40) and PD-1 expressed on T lymphocytes. Stimulation of OX40 may promote cytokine production and induce proliferation of memory and effector  T lymphocytes against tumor cells, while PD-1 binding disrupts PD-1 signaling and may restore immune function through the activation of T cells. This may enhance the immune-mediated elimination of tumor cells more effectively than PD-1 blockade or OX40-agonism alone.

BCMA, a tumor-specific antigen and a receptor for both a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and plays a key role in plasma cell survival. BCMA is found on the surfaces of plasma cells and overexpressed on malignant plasma cells."

Upon reintroduction into the patient, the autologous CD19/PD-1 bispecific CAR-T cells target and bind to CD19 and the PD-1 ligands, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), expressed on tumor cells.

The binding of the PD1/CD28 chimera to PD-L1 prevents the normal PD1/PD-L1-mediated T-cell suppression and, instead, promotes signaling through the CD28 domain, which results in the stimulation of T lymphocytes.

The expression of IFN-a2 is tightly controlled by the human angiopoietin receptor Tie2 enhancer/promoter sequence, found in the tumor-infiltrating macrophages Tie2 expressing monocytes (TEMs), and is under microRNA-126 (miR-126)-mediated control. This enables suppression of IFN-a2 expression in HSPCs while IFN-a2 is selectively expressed in TEMs. Upon administration of the autologous CD34+-enriched HSPCs transduced with VSV-G encoding IFN-a2, the HSPCs travel to the bone marrow and differentiate into various cells including monocytes and macrophages. These cells travel to the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the TEMs, capable of expressing IFN-a2, specifically release IFN-a2 in the TME. IFN-2a binds to specific IFN cell-surface receptors, and activates IFN-mediated signal transduction, resulting in the transcription and translation of genes containing an interferon-specific response element whose protein products mediate anticancer and anti-angiogenic effects. This results in the induction of both G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, IFN-a2 triggers an indirect anti-tumor immune response involving the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs), and the induction of immune effector cell cytotoxicity, thereby further killing tumor cells. TEMs, a subset of tumor-infiltrating macrophages characterized by expression of the tyrosine protein kinase angiopoietin receptor Tie2, are upregulated in the TME while infrequently found in normal organs.

        "text": "A preparation of CD4+ and CD8+ autologous T lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) composed of a short chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domain derived from depatuxizumab, a human anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (MAb806; ABT-806), coupled to the zeta chain of the TCR/CD3 complex (CD3-zeta) and the signaling domain of 4-1BB (CD137),  and linked to a truncated form of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Depatuxizumab specifically targets abnormal conformational states of EGFR, including the EGFR deletion mutation variant III (EGFRvIII), and activating mutations, with very low affinity for wild-type EGFR. Upon intravenous administration, the autologous CD4+/CD8+ EGFR806 specific 4-1BB-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing CAR T cells are directed to and induce selective toxicity in EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells. Devoid of both ligand binding domains and tyrosine kinase activity, the expressed EGFRt both facilitates in vivo detection of the administered, transduced T-cells and can promote elimination of these cells through an anti-EGFR antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response. EGFRvIII, an in-frame deletion of exons 2-7 in the EGFR gene, is overexpressed by a variety of cancer cell types but absent in normal, healthy cells. It plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis and resistance to both radio- and chemotherapy."

Upon isolation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), transduction, expansion ex vivo, priming of the Tn subset, but not the Tcm subset, with interleukin-21 (IL-21), and reintroduction of equal amounts of Tcm and Tn cells into the patient, WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8-positive Tcm/Tn lymphocytes redirect T-lymphocytes to WT1-expressing tumor cells and specifically bind to and lyse those cells.
