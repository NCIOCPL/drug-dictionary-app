				"text": "A nanoparticle-based metal-organic framework (MOF) compound composed of proprietary X-ray-absorbing metals, with potential radiosensitizing properties. Upon intratumoral administration and subsequent irradiation of the tumor site, RiMO-301 absorbs the X-ray photons and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, which induces ROS-mediated DNA damage in the irradiated cancer cells leading to tumor cell lysis. In addition, RiMO-301 may also contain an as of yet unidentified immunomodulating agent loaded into the channels/pores of the construct that may induce an immune response against the tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) released by the lysed tumor cells, thereby locally killing additional tumor and non-tumor cells.

				"text": "A recombinant immunotoxin consisting of the Fv portion of the anti-CD22 antibody covalently fused to a 38 KDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin-A (PE38) with potential antineoplastic activity. The Fv portion of anti-CD22 immunotoxin CAT-8015 binds to CD22, a cell surface receptor expressed on a variety of malignant B cells, thereby delivering the toxin moiety PE38 directly to tumor cells. Once internalized, PE38 induces caspase-mediated apoptosis via a mechanism involving mitochondrial damage and blocks translational elongation by binding to elongation factor 2 (EF-2).
