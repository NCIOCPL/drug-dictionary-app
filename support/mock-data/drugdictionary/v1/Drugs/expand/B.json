Upon intramuscular injection, the polymer moiety of BP-Cx1-Platinum Complex BP-C1 (BP-C1) alters the permeability of the cell membranes, which allows for increased penetration of platinum into tumor cells. In turn, platinum binds to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA and induces intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. In addition, the BP-Cx1 ligand is able to stimulate the innate immune system and upregulates a variety of cytokines including interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and various interleukins (ILs) such as IL-6 and IL-25. In comparison to cisplatin and other platinum–based compounds, treatment with BP-C1 allows for less platinum administration, which reduces platinum-associated systemic toxicity and side effects, and enhances the safety profile while maintaining or improving its efficacy.",
				"text": "A combination agent composed of the benzo-poly-carbonic-acid polymer BP-Cx1 chelated to platinum with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intramuscular injection, the polymer moiety of BP-Cx1-Platinum Complex BP-C1 (BP-C1) alters the permeability of the cell membranes, which allows for increased penetration of platinum into tumor cells. In turn, platinum binds to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA and induces intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.

In addition, BCAAs inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of HCC cells by both suppressing the expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. BCAAs also correct the plasma amino acid imbalance and promote protein metabolism, including the synthesis of albumin and glycogen. They reduce oxidative stress by inducing the activation of genes involved in antioxidant defenses, which prevent the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). BCAAs also strengthen the immune system by increasing hepatic lymphocytes and stimulating natural killer (NK) cell activity. This supplement is able to improve insulin resistance and promote ammonia detoxification through increased glutamine (Gln) production."
